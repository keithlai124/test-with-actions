## Step 2: Workflow files

The best way to add automation to your project's repository is with a GitHub Actions Workflow. Let's look at the anatomy of a workflow then create 2 of them.

### What are the parts of workflow?

![An illustration with a left half and a right half. On the left: illustration of how GitHub Actions terms are encapsulated. At the highest level: workflows and event triggers. Inside workflows: jobs and definition of the build environment. Inside jobs: steps. Inside steps: a call to an action. On the right: the evaluated sequence: workflow, job, step, action.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88589835-f5ce0900-d016-11ea-8c8a-0e7d7907c713.png)

- **Workflow**: A unit of automation from start to finish. It starts when the trigger (`on`) matches an activity in the repository and runs 1 or more jobs.

- **Jobs**: The workflow's jobs each run in their own isolated environments and can be configured differently. They run in parallel unless configured otherwise or dependencies are set.

- **Steps**: The steps area is a series of related actions that achieve a job's goal. A step can be a pre-made _Action_ from the Actions Marketplace, a private workflow, or even a custom script.

- **Action**: Each step is an _Action_, a piece of automation written in a way that is compatible with workflows. Actions can be written by GitHub, by the open source community, or specific to the project.

In the above `Example Workflow` file, it will start when any commits are pushed to the repository on any branch. It will run 1 job with the name `build`. That job's first step uses a pre-made _Action_ from the `actions` organization named `checkout` that clones the code from the repository into the job's environment.

You can explore all of the configuration options in the [GitHub Actions Docs](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Add a workflow to run tests

1. Open a web browser tab and navigate to this exercise repository. The Codespace is not needed right now.

1. In the top navigation, select the **Actions** tab.

1. In the left navigation, above list of workflows, click the **New workflow** button.

1. Enter `python` into the search box and click the **Enter** button.

   <img width="300" alt="search box with 'python' value" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34f2795c-85e8-4dc8-b03b-eac73e70e309" />

1. Find the **Python package** workflow and click the **Configure** button to open a file editor with a pre-made workflow.

   <img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a2ff616-aedd-41b5-a24c-82014e98bbee" />

1. Above the file editor, update the file name.

   ```txt
   python-tests.yml
   ```

1. Around line 4, update the workflow name.

   ```yml
   name: Python Tests
   ```

1. Around line 6, simplify the `on` trigger to only use pull requests.

   ```yml
   on:
     pull_request:
       branches: ["main"]
   ```

1. Around line 17, update the matrix strategy to use more Python versions.

   ```yml
   python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]
   ```

1. Around line 36, change the command to create coverage results.

   ```yml
   - name: Run tests
     run: |
       pytest --verbose
   ```

1. At the very end, add another job that will verify all versions passed. Note: this is a job, not a step.

   {% raw %}

   ```yml
   python-tests:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     needs: [python-tests-by-version]
     if: always()
     steps:
       - name: All pass
         if: ${{ !(contains(needs.*.result, 'failure')) }}
         run: exit 0
       - name: Any fail
         if: ${{ contains(needs.*.result, 'failure') }}
         run: exit 1
   ```

   {% endraw %}

   > **üí° Note:** This is not usually required, but it simplifies our ruleset in the next step since rulesets require selecting specific job names.

1. Above the editor, on the right, click the **Commit changes...** button. Commit directly to the `main` branch.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Add a workflow to show test coverage

1. Switch to the VS Code Codespace.

1. Check the status bar for a pending update. Click it to pull your recently committed workflow.

   <img width="130" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3eb17cf-a18e-4fae-bf18-cda900c7c6d3" />

1. In the left navigation, select the **Explorer** tab to show the project files.

1. Expand the `.github/workflows/` folder.

1. Add a new file with the following name and open it.

   ```txt
   python-coverage.yml
   ```

1. Enter the name and set it to trigger on pull requests targeting the `main` branch.

   ```yml
   name: Python Coverage

   on:
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main

   permissions:
     pull-requests: write
   ```

1. Add the `python-coverage` job and a first step that gets the repository content.

   ```yml
   jobs:
     python-coverage:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v4
   ```

1. Add steps to install Python and required packages.

   ```yml
   - name: Set up Python
     uses: actions/setup-python@v4
     with:
       python-version: 3.13

   - name: Install dependencies
     run: |
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       pip install coverage==7.9
       pip freeze
   ```

1. Add steps to run the coverage report and save for later use.

   ```yml
   - name: Run tests to generate coverage details
     run: |
       coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests -p "*_test.py"

   - name: Create reports in multiple formats
     id: coverage-results
     run: |
       # Output full textual coverage report
       echo "text_report<<EOF" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
       coverage report >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
       echo "EOF" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

       # Generate XML and HTML reports
       coverage xml
       coverage html
   ```

1. Parse XML report to get any desired results.

   ```yml
   - name: Parse XML report to get overall percentage
     id: coverage-summary
     continue-on-error: true
     uses: actions/github-script@v7
     with:
       script: |
         const fs = require('fs');

         // Read the XML file
         const xmlData = fs.readFileSync('coverage.xml', 'utf8');

         // Extract line-rate using regex (simpler than XML parsing)
         const lineRateMatch = xmlData.match(/line-rate="([0-9.]+)"/);

         if (!lineRateMatch) {
            throw new Error('Could not find line-rate in coverage.xml');
         }

         // Save line-rate value to an output variable
         const lineRate = lineRateMatch[1];
         core.setOutput('line_rate', lineRate);
   ```

1. Attach coverage reports to workflow run.

   ```yml
   - name: Attach coverage reports to workflow run
     uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
     with:
       name: coverage-reports
       path: |
         coverage.xml
         htmlcov/
   ```

1. Add a final step to share the coverage report as a comment on the pull requests.

   {% raw %}

   ```yml
   - name: Post coverage comment
     uses: actions/github-script@v7
     env:
       GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
       RUN_ID: ${{ github.run_id }}
       REPO_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}
       ISSUE_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
       COVERAGE_REPORT_TEXT: ${{ steps.coverage-results.outputs.text_report }}
       COVERAGE_REPORT_LINE_RATE: ${{ steps.coverage-summary.outputs.line_rate }}
       MINIMUM_COVERAGE: 0.9
     with:
       script: |
         // The workflow run URL, where the reports are attached
         const workflowRunUrl = `https://github.com/${process.env.REPO_NAME}/actions/runs/${process.env.RUN_ID}`;

         // Calculate coverage percentage and determine pass/fail
         const minimumCoverage = parseFloat(process.env.MINIMUM_COVERAGE).toFixed(2);
         const coveragePercentage = parseFloat(process.env.COVERAGE_REPORT_LINE_RATE).toFixed(2);
         const isPassingCoverage = coveragePercentage >= minimumCoverage;
         const statusIcon = isPassingCoverage ? '‚úÖ' : '‚ùå';
         const statusText = isPassingCoverage ? 'PASS' : 'FAIL';

         // Create the comment
         const commentBody = `
         ### ${statusIcon} Test Coverage Report
         **Coverage Overall**: \`${coveragePercentage * 100}%\`
         **Coverage Required**: \`${minimumCoverage * 100}%\`

           issue_number: Number(process.env.ISSUE_NUMBER),
           body: commentBody
         });
   ```

   {% endraw %}

1. Commit and push the changes to your `python-coverage.yml` file to the `main` branch.

> [!TIP]
> We used custom steps here to show the flexibility of Actions. There are several AWESOME pre-made options from the community on the free [Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions). Consider trying one of them out before you build your own!

1. With both new workflows pushed to GitHub, Mona will review your work and post the next steps.

<!-- ### (optional) ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Filter triggers by file type

Our current workflow will trigger on any pull request targeting `main`, even if it doesn't change the code. That is unnecessary. -->

<!-- ### (optional) Activity: Ask Copilot to enable package caching

If you have Copilot, give the following prompt a try.
It will modify your workflow add caching between the workflow runs, making it much faster. Nice!

```prompt
Hey Copilot, these workflows take a while to run. Can you enable enable caching for installing the python version and required packages? The goal is to avoid constantly re-downloading the resources, which should make things faster.
