## Step 2: Workflow files

The best way to add automation to your project's repository is with a GitHub Actions Workflow. Let's look at the anatomy of a workflow then create 2 of them.

### What are the parts of workflow?

![An illustration with a left half and a right half. On the left: illustration of how GitHub Actions terms are encapsulated. At the highest level: workflows and event triggers. Inside workflows: jobs and definition of the build environment. Inside jobs: steps. Inside steps: a call to an action. On the right: the evaluated sequence: workflow, job, step, action.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6351798/88589835-f5ce0900-d016-11ea-8c8a-0e7d7907c713.png)

- **Workflow**: A unit of automation from start to finish. It starts when the trigger (`on`) matches an activity in the repository and runs 1 or more jobs.

- **Jobs**: The workflow's jobs each run in their own isolated environments and can be configured differently. They run in parallel unless configured otherwise or dependencies are set.

- **Steps**: The steps area is a series of related actions that achieve a job's goal. A step can be a pre-made _Action_ from the Actions Marketplace, a private workflow, or even a custom script.

- **Action**: Each step is an _Action_, a piece of automation written in a way that is compatible with workflows. Actions can be written by GitHub, by the open source community, or specific to the project.

In the above `Example Workflow` file, it will start when any commits are pushed to the repository on any branch. It will run 1 job with the name `build`. That job's first step uses a pre-made _Action_ from the `actions` organization named `checkout` that clones the code from the repository into the job's environment.

You can explore all of the configuration options in the [GitHub Actions Docs](https://docs.github.com/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).

### ⌨️ Activity: Add a workflow to run tests

1. Open a web browser tab and navigate to this exercise repository. The Codespace is not needed right now.

1. In the top navigation, select the **Actions** tab.

1. In the left navigation, above list of workflows, click the **New workflow** button.

1. Enter `python` into the search box and click the **Enter** button.

1. Find the **Python package** workflow and click the **Configure** button to open a file editor with a pre-made workflow.

   <img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a2ff616-aedd-41b5-a24c-82014e98bbee" />

1. Above the file editor, update the file name.

   ```txt
   python-tests.yml
   ```

1. Around line 4, update the workflow name.

   ```yml
   name: Python Tests
   ```

1. Around line 6, simplify the `on` trigger to only use pull requests.

   ```yml
   on:
     pull_request:
       branches: ["main"]
   ```

1. Around line 17, update the matrix strategy to use more Python versions.

   ```yml
   python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]
   ```

1. Around line 36, change the command to show more details in the logs.

   ```yml
   - name: Run tests
     run: |
       pytest --verbose
   ```

1. Above the editor, on the right, click the **Commit changes...** button. Commit directly to the `main` branch.

### ⌨️ Activity: Add a workflow to show test coverage

1. Switch to the VS Code Codespace.

1. Check the status bar for a pending update. Click it to pull your recently committed workflow.

   <img width="130" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3eb17cf-a18e-4fae-bf18-cda900c7c6d3" />

1. In the left navigation, select the **Explorer** tab to show the project files.

1. Expand the `.github/workflows/` folder.

1. Add a new file with the following name and open it.

   ```txt
   python-coverage.yml
   ```

1. Enter the name and set it to trigger on pull requests targeting the `main` branch.

   ```yml
   name: Python Coverage

   on:
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main

   permissions:
     pull-requests: write
   ```

1. Add the `python-coverage` job and a first step that gets the repository content.

   ```yml
   jobs:
     python-coverage:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v4
   ```

1. Add steps to install Python and required packages.

   ```yml
   - name: Set up Python
     uses: actions/setup-python@v4
     with:
       python-version: 3.13

   - name: Install dependencies
     run: |
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       pip install pytest==8.4.1
       pip install coverage==7.9
       pip install pytest-cov==6.2.1
   ```

1. Add steps to run the coverage report on the `src` folder.

   ```yml
   - name: Run tests and generate coverage details
     run: |
       pytest --cov=src
   ```

1. Add a final step to uses a pre-made GitHub Action that shares the coverage report as a comment on the pull requests.

   {% raw %}

   ```yml
   - name: Coverage comment
     uses: py-cov-action/python-coverage-comment-action@v3
     with:
       GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
   ```

   {% endraw %}

1. Commit and push the changes to your `python-coverage.yml` file to the `main` branch.

> [!TIP]
> Dis you notice the `uses:` statements? Those pre-made steps on the free [Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions). Consider trying one of them out before you build your own! There are lots of AWESOME creations from the community!

1. With both new workflows pushed to GitHub, Mona will review your work and post the next steps.

<!-- ### (optional) ⌨️ Activity: Filter triggers by file type

Our current workflow will trigger on any pull request targeting `main`, even if it doesn't change the code. That is unnecessary. -->

<!-- ### (optional) Activity: Ask Copilot to enable package caching

If you have Copilot, give the following prompt a try.
It will modify your workflow add caching between the workflow runs, making it much faster. Nice!

```prompt
Hey Copilot, these workflows take a while to run. Can you enable enable caching for installing the python version and required packages? The goal is to avoid constantly re-downloading the resources, which should make things faster.
